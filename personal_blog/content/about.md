Hi there!

My name is Justin, and I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Philosophy in June 2023. I also did a second major in Computer Science during my time in University. Before University, I was neither interested in tech nor considered a career in it. It was only after doing a mandatory computational reasoning module did I find out that I enjoyed the process of solving problems computationally, and by extension, coding. I then started doing foundational computer science modules and I've never looked back since.

During my time in school I enjoyed learning about algorithms and computational complexity theory the most, and I hope to one day continue studying those topics a little more. I'm currently focused on improving my knowledge in cybersecurity and adjacent topics. I'm currently striving to improve my technical knowledge and practical skills, but I hope to one day work in threat intelligence research and investigation.

This website is mainly for me to document the work I've done, the things I've learnt, and the skills I have. I might write about other topics in the future (philosophy perhaps?) if anything comes to mind, but since I'm currently focused on cybersecurity, my writeups will mostly be about cybersecurity and tech for now.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-ngo-359397202/).

Thank you for visiting!
